                <p id="p2s6">1. Do you think keeping all of my projects in the digital sphere is a “bad thing”? Would my work benefit from adding something like a physical book of digital images of the tools in use, or would it feel disjointed at this point?</p>
                <p id="p3s6">2. As far as presenting at GradEx, any ideas for the best way to approach showing so many digital projects?</p>
                <p id="p4s6">Bonus: Anything you think would be cool to see added to my community garden website?</p>
